2021-01-24 - no ideas really.

2021-01-25 - Didn't really think about code today.  Looks like I'll be a VIM environment though, so I'll try to collect some dotfiles for that here.

2021-01-26 - Upgraded Maple to Leopard.   Going to upgrade to XCode 3 and try to compile libtcod again.  Might get some Roguelike work done soon!
